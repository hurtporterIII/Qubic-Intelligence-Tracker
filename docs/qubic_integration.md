# Qubic Integration

WhaleTrack-AI integrates with Qubic to listen for on-chain data directly.

Key Points:
- We use the Qubic API or a wrapped data feed.
- Only large transactions are filtered.
- Data enters the pipeline through the n8n workflow.
- No complex blockchain node is required.

This makes WhaleTrack-AI extremely lightweight and easy to host.

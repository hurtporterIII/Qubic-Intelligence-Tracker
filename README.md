# WhaleTrack-AI

WhaleTrack-AI is a real-time automated whale-transaction tracker that listens for large token movements, stores them in Airtable, and pushes formatted alerts directly to Discord.

This repository contains:
- The Airtable schema used for transaction capture  
- The n8n workflow JSON (automation pipeline)  
- Documentation for setup and reproduction  
- Demo assets for the hackathon submission

More components will be added as the project progresses.
